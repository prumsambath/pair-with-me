# Pair with Me!

This is my personal project for the [RMU](http://university.rubymendicant.com/) February Session that I'm participating in.

## Description
__Pair with Me__ is a web application helps geeks to find their partners who get the same interests and make pair requests to them. Geeks setup their profile with some information such as summury, skills and interests, time zone, availability, github id, twitter id, website.

## Installation
    cd pair-with-me
    bundle install

## Contributions
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Push commits to your own repository.
* Send me a pull request.
